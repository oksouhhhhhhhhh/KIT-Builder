# KIT Builder
A GitHub page to create custom KITs for the Roblox randomizer experience "item asylum" (and to later on also include other randomizer games on Roblox).  The page currently only supports KITs from item asylum, to change the font size of any class you can use inspect element to change it. Feel free to contribute towards this to make it better. All of the images used in this project are made by (Jean's Bizarre Community)[https://www.roblox.com/communities/6356872/Jeans-Bizarre-Community].

You can find the link to the GitHub page here: https://oksouhhhhhhhhh.github.io/KIT-Builder/
