# KIT Builder
A GitHub page to create custom KITs for the Roblox randomizer experience "item asylum" (and to later on also include other randomizer games on Roblox). Feel free to contribute towards this to make it better. All of the images used in this project are made by [Jean's Bizarre Community](https://www.roblox.com/communities/6356872/Jeans-Bizarre-Community). All of the code used in styles.css is used in [JBC Studios Wiki](jbcstudios.miraheze.org).

You can find the link to the GitHub page here: https://oksouhhhhhhhhh.github.io/KIT-Builder/
